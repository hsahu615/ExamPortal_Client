# Lex
A exam portal project based on Angular and Springboot, here I have used <b>JWT</b> for authentication, it can have Admin and User sign in.
This is a full fledged project where proper routing, authentication, interceptors and guarding have been used.
Admin can set categories, quizzes, and questions.
Users can attempt quizzes and see how many marks they scored in the respective quiz.
